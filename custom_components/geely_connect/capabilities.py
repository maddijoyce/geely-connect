"""Parse the Geely capability catalog into a typed view.

The raw catalog is fetched from
`GET /geelyTCAccess/tcservices/capability/{VIN}` and returns ~65 entries
per vehicle. Each entry has a `functionId` (e.g. `remote_climate_control_2`),
a `valueEnable` boolean, and a `paramsJson` array describing what params
the function accepts and what value ranges are valid.

This module turns that into a small dict the platform setup files can
read to decide which entities to expose and what bounds to use.

Source: AVD packet capture (see docs/AVD_CAPTURE_GUIDE.md). Each function
listed below has been verified to appear in at least one real EX5
capability response.
