# The area belongs to the VEHICLE's telematics registration, not to the country
# typed at setup - a Brazilian account can have a car registered in NA - so it
# is read from the /controlCars response (tspInfo[].serviceRegion, falling back
# to edgeInfo.code) rather than from CONF_COUNTRY_CODE.
#
# Login, OTP and the vehicle list are NOT regional in practice: accounts in
# every region reach them through the EU host today, and only certificate
# provisioning and control commands are rejected. So a region swaps just
# `cert_host`, `control_host` and the signing credentials.

#
# On the "AVD-verified" labels below: they mark commands taken from an Android
# app capture that predates this repository's public history, so the capture
# itself cannot be produced. Treat the label as "worked when someone tried it",
# not as proof. Where owners have since confirmed the behaviour - the climate
# and seat commands, G-Clean, the charge-server family - it has earned its
# keep. Where owners contradict it, it has been removed: the tailgate entry
# below carried the same label and two owners report the app only unlocking
# and the key fob doing the opening.
# Rapid warm/cool is the exception - see SERVICE_RAPID_*_PATH below.

# --- Tailgate UNLOCK ---
# Uses RDU_2 (door-unlock service) with target=trunk - NOT a separate RTB
# service.
#
# FOUR owners now report that the official app only ever *unlocks* the tailgate
# and never opens it, across three trims - EX5 Inspire, EX5 Tech and P145 PHEV -
# with the powered open coming from the key fob long-press or the car's own
# screen (#14, #20). One owner reports otherwise; his is the single dissenting
# account and his issue stays open for it.
#
# So this is not a missing feature but the same action the app performs: the
# powered open appears not to be exposed by this cloud API at all, and the fob
# talks to the car over a channel nothing here can reach.
#
# Separately, and still open: the latch is confirmed RELEASING on three of those
# four cars (EX5 Tech, EX5 Inspire standard range, P145 PHEV). On the fourth the
# indicators flash and the latch does not move. That is a different fault from
# the powered-open question - the command not reaching the latch at all - and
# drivingSafetyStatus.trunkLockStatus (binary_sensor.<vin>_bs_trunk_unlocked) is
# what distinguishes the two.
#
# AND THE CATALOGUE SAYS AN OPEN COMMAND EXISTS, at least on the EX5. A real
# E245-J1 catalogue read in full for the first time (#20, 2026-08-09) declares an
# internally consistent triple:
#
#     remote_control_lock_2     valueEnum: door
#     remote_control_unlock_2   valueEnum: door,trunk
#     remote_control_open_2     valueEnum: trunk        <- valueEnable true
#
# A command named *open* whose only target is the trunk is a powered tailgate
# release, and that car advertises it as enabled. The three Starray (P145-J1)
# dumps on #11 do NOT carry it: `tailgate.enabled` is derived from that entry
# alone (capabilities.py) and is absent in all three, on integration versions
# 1.16.1 / 1.17.2 / 1.21.3 which all contained the derivation. So the two models
# genuinely differ, and it is the only capability flag that differs between them.
#
# Which leaves this integration in an odd position worth stating plainly: the
# button below is ENABLED BY the open capability and SENDS the unlock command.
# "It unlocks but does not open" is a description of our own code, not only of
# the car. By the RDL_2 / RDU_2 pattern the open service would be RDO_2, and
# nobody has fired it yet - no code change is needed to try, since fire_control
# takes any serviceId:
#
#     service_id: RDO_2
#     params: [{key: target, value: trunk}]
#
# Judge it by the gate, never by the response: RDU_2 answers code 1000 too.
#
# A powered tailgate is also usually an option rather than standard, which would
# let every account here be true at once - but that part is unproven and should
# stay labelled as such.
#
# No capture backs the serviceId spelling, and none backs the "~45s" figure that
