"""Adapter presenting the new-platform ZeekrClient as the integration's api.

The coordinator and every platform call the legacy GeelyApi surface
(vehicle_status / control / ...). This adapter implements that surface on
top of ZeekrClient so the new platform can slot in behind the CONF_PLATFORM
flag without touching any consumer.

Error mapping:
  - ZeekrAuthError / auth-looking ZeekrApiError  -> one silent HF renewal
    (_renew_hf: re-login from the stored password and re-mint the HF JWT),
    then GeelyAuthError (which drives the HA reauth flow).
  - Non-auth ZeekrApiError propagates (coordinator counts it toward its
    failure tolerance like any transient error).

Known gaps - raise cleanly, and the coordinator already treats
secondary-endpoint failures as non-fatal and carries state forward:
  - vehicle_status_state   (legacy /remote-control/vehicle/status/state/{vin})
  - charge_server_get      (legacy /charge-server/ecarx_charge_set GET)
  - scheduled_charging_set (charge-server write)
  - rapid_climate          (charge-server bizType=7 write)
  - fetch_capabilities     (legacy /geelyTCAccess/tcservices/capability)

Each gap maps to an endpoint family present in the new app's static
analysis (iovif.java lists /remote-control/* and /charge-server/* routes)
but none has been verified against the live new gateway, so they stay
explicitly unimplemented until the primary path is proven live.

        serviceId PAI with a single `pai=1` parameter, sent through the same
        control route as any other new-platform command. The legacy

        A vehicle WITHOUT an x-vin token is not a vehicle without a position.
        It is a new-platform account whose car is still read over the old
        backend, and every other call on that path already falls back to the
        legacy route - control() does exactly that thirty lines below, sending
        the telematics body over the same HF session. This one did not: it
        returned `{}`. No request, no exception, no log line. The car was
        therefore never asked for a fix, the cloud kept serving the last one it
